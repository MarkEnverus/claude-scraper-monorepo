# MISO CSAT Next-Day Short-Term Reserve Requirement Scraper

Collects next-day short-term reserve requirement data from MISO's public API.

## Data Source
- **URL**: https://public-api.misoenergy.org/api/CsatNextDayShortTermReserveRequirement
- **Format**: JSON
- **Update**: Daily by 2:00 PM EST
- **Historical**: Yes - supports date-based queries (date parameter in YYYY-MM-DD format)
- **Authentication**: None (public API)

## What is CSAT Next-Day Short-Term Reserve Requirement?

CSAT (Capacity Short of Adequacy Threshold) Next-Day Short-Term Reserve Requirement data provides MISO's assessment of short-term reserve requirements needed for the next operating day to maintain grid reliability.

Short-term reserves include:
- **Regulation Reserve**: Fast-responding reserves to maintain frequency (seconds to minutes)
- **Contingency Reserve**: Reserves to cover unexpected generator or transmission outages (minutes)

This data helps grid operators plan for adequate reserve procurement and provides early warning of potential adequacy concerns.

## Data Format

The API returns JSON with the following structure:

```json
{
  "operatingDay": "2025-01-01",
  "publishedTimestamp": "2024-12-31T14:00:00Z",
  "totalShortTermReserveRequirement": 2500.5,
  "reserveComponents": [
    {
      "type": "RegulationReserve",
      "value": 800.0,
      "unit": "MW"
    },
    {
      "type": "ContingencyReserve",
      "value": 1700.5,
      "unit": "MW"
    }
  ],
  "subregions": [
    {
      "name": "North",
      "shortTermReserveRequirement": 1200.0,
      "reserveDeficit": 0.0
    }
  ],
  "qualitativeAssessment": {
    "overallAdequacy": "Adequate",
    "uncertaintyFactor": 0.15,
    "recommendedActions": ["Monitor wind forecasts"]
  }
}
```

## Key Fields

- **operatingDay**: The operating day for the reserve requirements (YYYY-MM-DD)
- **totalShortTermReserveRequirement**: Total short-term reserve requirement in MW
- **reserveComponents**: Array of reserve components with type, value (MW), and unit
- **subregions**: Array of subregional requirements with name, requirement (MW), and deficit (MW)
- **qualitativeAssessment**: Object with overall adequacy, uncertainty factor (0.0-1.0), and recommended actions

## Validation

The scraper validates:
1. All required fields are present
2. Operating day matches requested date
3. Total requirement = sum of reserve components (arithmetic check)
4. Total requirement = sum of subregion requirements (arithmetic check)
5. Uncertainty factor is between 0.0 and 1.0
6. All MW values are non-negative
7. All units are "MW"

## Collection Strategy

Date-based historical collection:
- Query parameter: `date` in YYYY-MM-DD format
- Data published daily by 2:00 PM EST for next operating day
- Supports backfilling historical data
- One file per operating day stored with date partitioning
