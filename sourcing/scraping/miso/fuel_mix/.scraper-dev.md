# MISO Fuel Mix Scraper

Collects real-time fuel mix data from MISO's public API showing generation by fuel type.

## Data Source
- **URL**: https://public-api.misoenergy.org/api/FuelMix
- **Format**: JSON
- **Update**: Every 5 minutes (real-time)
- **Historical**: No - current snapshot only
- **Authentication**: None (public API)

## What is Fuel Mix?

Fuel Mix data shows the breakdown of electricity generation by fuel source in the MISO grid. This includes coal, natural gas, nuclear, wind, solar, and other sources. The data is updated every 5 minutes and represents the current state of the grid.

## Data Format

The API returns JSON with the following structure:
- **RefId**: Timestamp string (e.g., "03-Dec-2025 - Interval 12:55 EST")
- **TotalMW**: Total megawatts as string
- **Fuel.Type**: Array of fuel type objects with fields:
  - INTERVALEST: Timestamp
  - CATEGORY: Fuel category (Coal, Natural Gas, Nuclear, Wind, Solar, Other, Imports)
  - ACT: Megawatt output as string
  - FUEL_CATEGORY: Formatted description

## Collection Strategy

Since this is real-time data updated every 5 minutes, the scraper collects the current snapshot. Each collection creates a timestamped file for tracking generation mix over time.
